if path is provided or else crash reports are logged in you'r app's below directory
```
/Android/data/your-app-package-name/files/crashReports

### Using log Exception API
### If you want to capture exceptions then use below APIs in catch block 
for ex :
```
 try{
     //do your stuff
 }catch (Exception e){
     CrashReporter.logException(e);
 }
```
You can call any of below APIs in catch block.
```
logException(Exception exception)
```
Pass exception thrown in this method
```
logException(String exceptionMsg) 
```
Log your own error message 
```
logException(String exceptionPath, Exception exception)
```
Provide your own path to save crashes, passing null will save to default location
```
logException(String exceptionPath, String exceptionMsg)
```
Provide your own path and custome error message

Note : If you want to use external storage then add storage ermission
```
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
```
in you manifest file.

### To get default crash reports path call
```
CrashUtil.getDefaultPath()
```
you can access all crash log files from this path and upload them to server for your need. Remember it's default path 
if you provide your own path you know where to find the logs...
